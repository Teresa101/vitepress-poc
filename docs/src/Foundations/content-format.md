# Content Format

## Meaning and Message

People read content online differently than they do when reading a book or magazine. Review the tips below to learn how to format your content in a way that makes it easy for people to read and share.

## Capitalization

### Use Title Case for Headers, Titles and Navigation

Title Case (Headline Style): means the first letter of each word is capitalized, except for certain small words, such as articles, short prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions  (e.g., a, by, of, and, but, is, it, its, it's).

**Examples:** Sally Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore. The Tides of the North and Simmy the Beluga Whale.  Lighthouses of the New York Coast.

**Contextual Examples:** Primary Action Button, Continue to Payment, Save Report, Ok, Cancel, Save and Exit, Submit.

### Use Sentence Case for Content

Sentence case capitalizes the first word and any proper nouns listed within content as in normal sentences.

**Examples:** It was rainy outside today. I wore my raincoat to stay dry. My mother is traveling to Albany, New York today.
