## Meaning and Message

Color is the foundation of a visual vocabulary we use to express who and what we are as a company: contemporary, trustworthy, leading, reliable, caring, dependable, successful, vibrant, and focused. The Primerica color palette has been carefully chosen to express these and other key ideas and attributes. It’s important that we all understand and adhere to this palette to present a unified, consistent expression of the Primerica purpose, personality, and values.

## Primary

These are the bedrock colors of our company’s digital palette and, as such, should dominate any design. They echo the blue in the Primerica logo and instill a sense of confidence in our clients. The multiple shades of blue allow for design flexibility while maintaining the Primerica look and feel.

### Blue

## Accent

As the name suggests, accent colors highlight and amplify areas of exceptional interest or importance. Limited and purposeful use of these colors is best practice. Incorporating accent colors simply for design variety will reduce their effectiveness. Excessive use of these colors overshadows the primary colors and presents an unclear Primerica brand message.

### Green

### Cyan

## Neutral

Used in backgrounds, text and peripheral elements, these colors work in conjunction with primary, accent, and semantic colors to optimize them. It is the neutrality of these colors that allow other colors to stand out and make the greatest impact.

### Grey

### Blue Grey

## Semantic

Semantic Colors are universally recognized and reserved to identify specific types of messages and information. Avoid using these colors, or those closely resembling them, for general design. They should be used exclusively to indicate the following: Blue = Information; Green = Success, correct; Orange = Alert, caution; Red = Danger, error.

### Blue, Green, Orange & Red

## Supporting Semantic Colors

### Green

### Orange

### Red

## Gradients

While gradients can add visual interest, they are best used to illustrate and emphasize the concepts of progression, change, and movement. If overused or used without specific purpose, gradients can lose their effectiveness.

## ADA Color Compatibility

For greatest success, it’s important that Primerica digital communications be accessible to everyone. 
Just as importantly, our commitment to accessibility reinforces the Primerica values of inclusion 
and provides exceptional customer service. For these reasons, Primerica strives to have the proper color 
contrast ratios to comply with WCAG 2.0, Level AA. This includes, but is not limited to:


For normal text less than 24 px or less than 18pt, WCAG level AA requires a color contrast ratio of at least 4:5:1. 
Level AAA requires a ratio that’s equal to or more than 7:1. 


For large text equal to or more than 24 px or equal to or more than 18pt, WCAG level AA requires a color contrast ratio of at least 3:1. 
Level AAA requires a ratio that’s equal to or more than 4:5:1.
