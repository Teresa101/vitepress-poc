# Brand

The Primerica brand — the rings, the name, the colors — are the identity of the Company.
For that reason, it is critical to maintain brand integrity across all of Primerica's assets. 
The consistent use of brand elements defined in the Primerica Branding Guidelines supports 
our continued commitment to mainstreet America, and the opportunities we provide through financial independence.
