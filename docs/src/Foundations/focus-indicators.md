# Focus Indicators

## Meaning and Message

By defining a specific style for our focus indicators, we will create a smooth experience and maintain excellent compliance standards across all Primerica digital products. This page will cover the focus indicators used for links, buttons and inputs within the OneX design system.

## Recommended Style and Color

Style recommendation for all focus indicators is a 2 pixel outline, with a 2 pixel spacing offset. Focus color of the outline will either be the link color, for text links, or Blue 600 in our design system, depending on what component is being focused. See individual components for more details.
   
## Buttons

Buttons' focus color will be Blue 600 for the outline on light background and White for the outline on dark background.
